    <h2>The Best Yogurt Cake</h2>
    <p>
      Yogurt cake is easy to make, easy to adapt and uses basic household
      ingredients. Dress it up with whipped cream, fruit compote or powdered
      sugar for a springtime dessert.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup (226g) plain whole milk yogurt, regular or Greek</li>
      <li>
        1/2 cup vegetable oil, canola oil, or olive oil, plus more for coating
        the pan
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (192g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Preheat the oven, arrange rack, and grease baking dish: </strong
        >Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
        Grease a 9x5-inch or 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan lightly with olive oil
        and line it with parchment paper, leaving about a 1-inch overhang on the
        long sides, to make a sling.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Combine the wet ingredients: </strong>Crack the eggs into a
        large bowl, add the sugar, and whisk vigorously until pale yellow and
        frothy, about 1 minute. Whisk in the yogurt, oil, and vanilla extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Add the dry ingredients: </strong>To the bowl with the wet
        ingredients, whisk in the baking powder and kosher salt. Add the flour
        and stir with a rubber spatula until just combined and all of the flour
        is incorporated. (A few small lumps in the batter are fine, be sure to
        not overmix.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Transfer to prepared pan and bake: </strong> Transfer the
        batter to the prepared pan and use a spatula to spread it out evenly.
        Bake until the cake is lightly browned and a cake tester inserted into
        the center comes out clean with just a few crumbs, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Cool the cake: </strong>Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and
        let cool for 10 minutes before using the parchment paper sling to lift
        the cake out of the pan and onto the cooling rack to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Serve: </strong> Dust with powdered sugar, if desired, before
        slicing and serving.
      </li>
